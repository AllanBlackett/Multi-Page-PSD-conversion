## Project Description

This project is meant to emulate a common task I would normally perform as a front-end developer. I was provided a design and was tasked with building it with only HTML and CSS. The goals here are to execute the designer's vision on the web, and to build a good experience for my users regardless of the device on which they are viewing the site.

-Site is responsive and uses media queries

-Flexbox is used

-Sass variables are used

-All images considered content have descriptive alt text

-Form is accessible

-Mobile view provides good user experience

-Files, folders & naming conventions followed

-Project is organized using Sass partials (minimum 2)

-Project represents the provided design well

-Navigation should link to other pages made for the project
